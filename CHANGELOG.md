#### Deprecated
#### Removed

## [3.1.0] - 2016-01-26
#### Added
- Relay/GraphQL support.
- Passing `proxy` option through to server start method.  This allows things like the GraphQL proxy to be configured.
- Force min-version of Node at startup. (`>=5.5.0` as of version `3.0.3`).

#### Changed
- Referencing [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) dependencies via `js-babel` and `js-babel-dev` modules.
- Linting updated to use [AirBnB style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

#### Deprecated

#### Removed
- Removed the `bundle` and `bundle:init` scripts.  The UIHarness client is now bundled as a chunk within the main Webpack build.

## [3.0.0] - 2016-01-21
#### Added
- Bundling the UIHarness code itself as a static file so only the test specs/components are build (faster).
- `node bundle` command.

#### Changed
- Moved from WebPack middleware to use the `WebpackDevServer`.
  - This was done because reload issues were occurring with the middleware (it is less well supported) and is no longer necessary with an firmer understanding of the `proxy` feature of the `WebpackDevServer` which allows for a server-app to be used.




## [2.0.0] - 2016-01-04
#### Changed
- Updated to using Babel 6.



## [1.1.9] - 2015-12-04
#### Fixed
- Fixed breaking changes caused by updates to `react-schema` module.
